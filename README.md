# GraphQL React Sample Application
1) Just move to client folder and type <B>npm install</B>, It will pull react with grapql communication requirements.
2) Just move to server folder and type <B>npm install</B>, It will pull grapql requirement alone 
3) finally go inside server  and client folder and type npm start, the app will start to work.

Thanks
